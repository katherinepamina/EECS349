					What determines whether a song will top the charts or linger forever in the depths of the Weird Youtube of Yesteryear?  Our project aims to generate an accurate predictor of the popularity of a song.  A reliable hit predictor could be invaluable to several key players in the music industry.  Record companies wishing to discover new talent would be able to do so without hearing artists in person.  Singers themselves would learn what kinds of songs are most likely to project them into stardom.  Songwriters would know how to tailor songs to maximize popularity.<br><br>
					It is also interesting and worthwhile from a cultural standpoint to evaluate the ways in which factors contributing to a song's popularity have varied over time.  It is our secondary aim to gain insight into whether the nature of popular songs has changed over the decades.

					Our task is to predict a song's "hotttnesss" given its duration, energy, key, loudness, mode, tempo, danceability, year, and time signature.  The ability to predict a song's popularity is important because it has direct applications in music production and analyzing pop music trends.  Our results may have implications for what it takes for a song to become a hit, or whether a song's success can be predicted at all.

				<p>
					We used the <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset </a> (MSD), a collection of audio features and metadata of popular songs.  The subset that we used included the following seven attributes taken directly from the MSD:
					<ul>
						<li>the <b>key</b> that the song is in</li>
						<li>its <b>loudness</b> in decibels</li>
						<li>whether it is major or minor (<b>mode</b>)</li>
						<li><b>tempo</b> in beats per minute</li>
						<li>release <b>year</b></li>
						<li>the <b>time signature</b> in number of beats per bar</li>
						<li>and <b>popularity</b></li>
					</ul>
