					Our task is to predict a song's "hotttnesss" given its duration, energy, key, loudness, mode, tempo, danceability, year, and time signature.  The ability to predict a song's popularity is important because it has direct applications in music production and analyzing pop music trends.  Our results may have implications for what it takes for a song to become a hit, or whether a song's success can be predicted at all.

				<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
				<p>
					The dataset we have been using consists of a subset of the Million Song Dataset.  The attributes we used are duration (numeric), energy (numeric), key (nominal), loudness (numeric), mode (nominal), and tempo (numeric).  Song_hotttnesss is given as a numeric attribute.  We have 10,000 random examples chosen from the Million Song Dataset.  The full sample will be used for development, and we plan on using 40/40/20% for training/validation/testing.
